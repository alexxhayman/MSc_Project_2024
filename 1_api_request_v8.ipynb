    "Let's break down how this code works step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import Necessary Libraries**\n",
    "   - `requests` for making HTTP requests.\n",
    "   - `os` to access environment variables.\n",
    "   - `json` for JSON parsing and file operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialize API Details**\n",
    "   - `base_url` holds the endpoint URL of the 99 Spokes API for bike information.\n",
    "   - `auth_token` is fetched from an environment variable `MY_API_KEY`, ensuring that the API key is not hardcoded in the script. This is a security best practice.\n",
    "   - `headers` dictionary contains the API key under `x-api-key`, used for authenticating requests to the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Set Up Query Parameters**\n",
    "   - `params` dictionary contains parameters for the API request: year of the bikes, category (`road`), limit per request (`500`), and initial cursor value (`start`). These parameters help in filtering and paginating the API response.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fetch and Aggregate Data**\n",
    "   - An empty list `all_bikes` is initialized to store the fetched bike data.\n",
    "   - A `while` loop starts, making repeated requests to the API endpoint as long as there is data to fetch.\n",
    "   - Inside the loop, `requests.get()` is called with the API `base_url`, `headers`, and `params` to fetch the data. `.raise_for_status()` ensures that an exception is thrown for HTTP error responses, which helps in debugging failed requests.\n",
    "   - The response is parsed to JSON, and the `items` key is accessed to get the list of bikes, which is then extended into the `all_bikes` list.\n",
    "   - The `cursor` is checked in the response. If there's a `nextCursor`, the `params['cursor']` is updated to fetch the next set of data; otherwise, the loop breaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Save Data to JSON File**\n",
    "   - After exiting the loop, variables `year` and `category` are fetched from the `params` for use in naming the output file.\n",
    "   - The file name is dynamically created using `year` and `category`, ensuring that the saved file clearly indicates the data it contains.\n",
    "   - `json.dump()` writes the aggregated bike data into the named file in JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Print Summary**\n",
    "   - The total number of bikes fetched is printed, alongside a confirmation message indicating the completion of data retrieval and the file where the data is saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, the script robustly handles API communication, data fetching, and saving while maintaining good practices such as dynamic naming, pagination handling, and error checking."
